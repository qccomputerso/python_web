           (Please join with personal account)<hr/><font style="font-family:serif;">Do you know about 
            randomness? It sounds very mysterious, but it is one of the things that power your everyday life. 
            From machine learning to securing online payments, randomness is a very important and thoroughly 
            studied topic in Computer Science. SoCS is holding the O’Day on 15/10 (Fri). There will be a talk 
            about randomness, a quiz with prizes, and some short videos about different aspects of computer 
            science.</font></div>
